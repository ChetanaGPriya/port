                    <h4>My creative skills & experiences.</h4>
                    <p>As a Data Science Intern at Let’s Grow More, I focused on analyzing survey and feedback data for their educational courses. We collected responses in spreadsheets and CSV files, which I then cleaned and organized to improve data quality. Using exploratory data analysis, I identified key trends and insights from the feedback. This included handling missing values and standardizing data formats. I also applied machine learning models to uncover factors influencing student satisfaction. My work helped improve the understanding of course effectiveness and contributed to enhancing their educational services.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>During my tenure as a Project Assistant at Andhra University, I played a critical role in developing an automated system for managing the university’s newly constructed dormitories. Collaborating closely with the Head of the Department, I leveraged real-time student data to streamline various administrative tasks.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>During my internship as a Web Development Intern at Oasis Infobyte, I successfully developed five end-to-end user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My work involved designing and implementing robust backend databases with MySQL and XAMPP, ensuring efficient data storage, retrieval, and management.</p>

                        <h3>Computer Vision</h3>
                        <div class="sub-title">The project report, titled “Engagement Detection in a Classroom,” tackles the difficulty educators face in consistently assessing student engagement and emotional states using traditional methods. In diverse and dynamic classroom settings, these methods often lead to inconsistent and biased results. <br>To address this, the project proposes a computer vision (CV) system that automatically analyzes visual cues like facial expressions, hand raises, and head movements. This system aims to give real-time, objective feedback to teachers, helping them to quickly adjust their teaching to better engage students.

                            <br>The CV system uses advanced techniques to monitor student behavior continuously. By integrating cameras into classrooms, the system captures and analyzes visual data, using models like MTCNN for face detection and MediaPipe for hand tracking. The data is then displayed on a dashboard, providing educators with insights into student engagement and allowing for quick identification of students who may need extra support. This approach not only improves the immediate learning experience but also can be expanded to monitor multiple classrooms, enhancing overall educational practices. The system is designed to be easy to deploy and maintain, ensuring minimal disruption to the classroom while providing ongoing, valuable insights.</div>

                        <div class="sub-title">The "Restaurant Recommendation System" was developed to connect diners with top-quality restaurants in Arizona using Yelp's datasets. This project focuses on building a platform that personalizes dining recommendations by analyzing Yelp reviews, business ratings, and user engagement.<br> Leveraging techniques such as text mining and collaborative filtering, the system provides tailored suggestions that align with users' dining preferences, enhancing their overall experience.
                        

                            <br>The system utilizes Yelp data to highlight restaurants with high ratings and positive reviews, particularly from elite users. It combines collaborative filtering, which analyzes user rating patterns, with content-based filtering, which matches restaurant features to user preferences. This dual approach ensures that recommendations are both relevant and personalized, making it easier for diners to discover their ideal dining spots in Arizona.</div>

Specializing in a variety of properties such as apartments, houses, and commercial spaces across several states, there is a challenge of effectively allocating its substantial budget to meet the diverse demands of its clients, including real estate agents, individual buyers, and corporate offices. The project provides a Linear Programming (LP) model to optimize the allocation of resources and types of construction projects, aiming to maximize profitability.<br>

                            By analyzing factors like material and labor costs, machinery, and land, the project identifies the most profitable construction types and sizes, which attract clients. The strategic mix of project types ensures that it can meet market needs.</div>

                        <h3>Lean Six Sigma Case Study</h3>
                        <div class=""sub-title>This Lean Six Sigma project focused on optimizing Gentech’s proposal creation process to enhance efficiency and reduce cycle times. Gentech, a leading multinational technology company, was experiencing significant delays in creating sales proposals, which impacted its competitiveness. <br>The project aimed to streamline this process by identifying and eliminating inefficiencies, standardizing practices, and reducing unnecessary steps. Detailed analysis of the process from initial sales opportunity identification to final proposal submission highlighted areas of improvement, especially in configuration approvals and pricing steps.

                            Key findings included delays due to non-standard practices, redundant tasks, and extensive hand-offs among the Bid Support Specialists (BSS). The analysis utilized data from Gentech’s ERP system to track and understand these inefficiencies. <br>Recommendations were made to enhance the expertise of BSS through targeted training, streamline information collection processes, and simplify the pricing approval steps. These changes were designed to significantly cut down cycle times, improve process consistency, and enable Gentech to respond more swiftly and effectively to market demands. The overall goal was to reduce the average proposal creation cycle time by 15%, thereby boosting Gentech’s operational efficiency and competitive position.</div>

This project was aimed at significantly improving the efficiency of handling student data and streamlining various administrative tasks. 
                            <br>The primary objective was to transition from manual processes to a more automated system, which ultimately saved the staff approximately five hours of work each day.

                            Using a combination of HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL, I developed a comprehensive and user-friendly platform. This platform was designed to manage a wide range of functions, including student attendance tracking, payment processing, and detailed management of student profiles and administrative records. 
                            <br>The system’s ability to provide real-time updates and reports was particularly impactful, allowing staff to monitor and respond to student needs more effectively.
